The app has one goal:
- Support logistics through a forecast of expected volume on SKU's per account.

The salesteam can add an estimated volume on an account level with an start and an end date.
This will be displayed as a total sum per SKU on the homepage with a forecast of three months: The current month and the next two.

If the SKU has an end-date in the next two months it will no longer count in the total sum.
Same for a later start-date.
